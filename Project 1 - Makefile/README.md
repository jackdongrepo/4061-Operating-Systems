To complete this assignment, our group met three times:

## 09/24/18:

We met at 6:00pm in KH 1-250 and worked on completing phase 1 and an initial attempt at phase 2.
We partner programmed on one machine after setting up a repository on the U's GitHub. Our initial
attempt was to implement the fork, exec, and wait portion of our build method.

## 09/30/18:

We met at 4:00pm in KH 1-250 to fine tune our build method. Jack worked on understanding how we want
to deal with dependency modification times, Derek worked on pointer handling and the effects of recursion,
Pierre worked on implementing status assignments and checks at right steps in the recursion.

## 10/30/18:

We met at 6:00pm in KH 1-250 again. We worked together on running the testcases provided and comparing 
the output of our program to that of GNU make. We also fixed error handling so that the program indicates 
(when exiting) what target failed to build. 


*Note:* We included our phase 1 code along with several #ifdef DEBUG statements in phase 1 & 2 that were used for debugging.
